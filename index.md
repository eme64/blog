title: Emanuel's Hotspot JVM C2 Blog
---

My name is [Emanuel Peter](https://github.com/eme64). This blog focuses on my work I do in the C2 compiler of the Hotspot JVM.

I currently work at Oracle as an [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) compiler engineer. The views expressed on this blog are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer.

I hope I will be helpful to you. But read at your own risk, I am writing about things that I only just learned myself.

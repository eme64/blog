Summary:
- Running a simple Java example.
- TODO

```
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Especially with a debug build, the JVM startup can take a while, so it can take
        // a while until our code is executed.
        System.out.println("Run");

        // Repeatedly call the test method, so that it can become hot and get JIT compiled.
        for (int i = 0; i < 10_000; i++) {
            test(i, i + 1);
        }
        System.out.println("Done");
    }
    
    // The test method we will focus on.
    public static int test(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```
